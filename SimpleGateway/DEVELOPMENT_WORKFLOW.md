# Development Workflow for Continuous Healthcare Platform Expansion

## 🏠 Local Development Environment
Your current setup is perfect for ongoing development:

### Current State ✅
- ✅ Application running locally: http://localhost:5159
- ✅ Entity Framework with LocalDB for instant testing
- ✅ Hot reload for immediate code changes
- ✅ Full debugging capabilities in VS Code
- ✅ Database with seed data for testing

### Development Cycle 🔄
1. **Code Changes** - Edit controllers/views/models in VS Code
2. **Instant Testing** - App auto-reloads at localhost:5159
3. **Database Changes** - EF automatically updates LocalDB
4. **Test Features** - Use test accounts (performer1, admin, etc.)
5. **Deploy When Ready** - Push to Azure when feature is complete

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy for Ongoing Development

### Quick Deploy Script (Updated)
I've created a streamlined deployment script for your workflow:

```powershell
# Quick deploy after making changes
.\quick-deploy.ps1
```

### Database Migration Strategy
For ongoing development with database changes:

1. **Local Changes** - Make model updates locally
2. **Create Migration** - `dotnet ef migrations add NewFeatureName`
3. **Test Locally** - Verify changes work with LocalDB
4. **Deploy to Azure** - Migration runs automatically on Azure

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow for Your Use Case

### Daily Development
- **Work locally** with instant feedback
- **Test thoroughly** with your seed data
- **Commit changes** to git (optional but recommended)

### When Ready to Deploy
- **Run quick deploy script** (takes 2-3 minutes)
- **Test live version** at your Azure URL
- **Continue local development** for next feature

### For New Features (like questionnaires)
- **Add models locally** first
- **Test the feature** completely
- **Create migration** for database changes
- **Deploy everything** together

## 🔧 Tools You Have Ready

### Development Tools ✅
- **VS Code** with Azure extensions
- **Entity Framework** for database changes
- **LocalDB** for instant local testing
- **Hot reload** for immediate feedback

### Deployment Tools ✅
- **deploy-to-azure.ps1** - Full deployment script
- **Azure CLI** integration
- **Automated database migration**
- **Connection string management**

## 📈 Future Expansion Ready

### For Questionnaire System
When you're ready to add questionnaires:
1. **Add models** to QuestionnaireModels.cs (already created)
2. **Update DbContext** to include new tables
3. **Create migration** - `dotnet ef migrations add AddQuestionnaires`
4. **Test locally** with your workflow
5. **Deploy to Azure** when ready

### For Additional Features
- **New controllers** - Add to Controllers folder
- **New views** - Add to Views folder
- **New models** - Add to Models folder
- **Database changes** - Always create migrations

The architecture is designed to scale with your development pace!
