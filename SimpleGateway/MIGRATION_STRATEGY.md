## SimpleGateway Production Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Database Layer (No UI Changes)
- Add Entity Framework Core alongside existing hardcoded users
- Create database models that mirror current structure
- Implement repository pattern for data access
- Keep existing controllers working during transition

### Phase 2: Enhanced Authentication (Minimal UI Impact)
- Add password hashing (BCrypt)
- Implement JWT tokens alongside sessions
- Add user registration/management APIs
- Current login UI remains unchanged

### Phase 3: Advanced Dashboard Features
- Build on existing dashboard structure
- Add real learning modules and progress tracking
- Implement file uploads and content management
- Enhance performer dashboards with actual functionality

### Phase 4: Production Deployment
- Cloud hosting setup (Azure/AWS)
- SSL certificates and domain configuration
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Backup and disaster recovery

### Key Benefits of This Approach:
1. **No Backwards Steps**: Current working system remains functional
2. **Incremental Upgrades**: Each phase adds value without breaking existing features
3. **Easy Rollback**: Can revert to previous working state at any point
4. **Continuous Demo**: System remains demonstrable throughout development

### Technology Stack Advantages:
- **.NET Core 9.0**: Long-term support, cross-platform
- **MVC Pattern**: Industry standard, highly maintainable
- **Bootstrap 5**: Mobile-first, widely supported
- **Entity Framework**: ORM with excellent hosting provider support
- **Session/JWT**: Standard authentication methods for web applications
